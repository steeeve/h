# A tiny house project.

Includes principal design, and ever evolving framing schematic (at least until I build the damn thing).

## Requirements

- [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/)

## Decisions

### The timber
* 38mm x 75mm
* seems readily available.

### The osb
* 18mm x 2440mm x 1220mm
* seems readily available

### The Trailer
* 4267mm (14ft) x 2032mm (6ft8)
* fairly arbitry, particularly the width, found a trailer this size at: http://www.trailers.co.uk/Product/Flatbed/TW_Flatbed/TWF006

### Shower room / doorway
* 700mm square, small standard tray
* 680mm door, small standard width

Have made size a lot smaller after bumping it up. Couldn't remember
why I'd originally made the width so small (was to fit trailer).
Reduced length to 14ft to make it easier to manouver -the smaller
houses on tumbleweed are this size so presumably this is reasonable.

Thinking about the schematics, perhaps it should be box, osb,
then build an internal platform, then the internal floor on
the platform, rather than nailing it to the walls!

Spoke to Kris about internal floor -just needs to be bolted
to walls since I've built the propped cross-beams.

Is the mezzane big enough? only gives 5cm head clearance.
